## Overview

This project aims for an analysis of CO2 yearly intensity data for European countries from 1990 to 2017. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into the trends and variations in carbon emissions within the European region.

## Dataset
The dataset was taken from KAGGLE, and can be found in this link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/co2-intensity-of-electricity-generation/

It includes the following key information:

CO2 yearly intensity (in gCO2/kWh) for European countries.
Years from 1990 to 2017.

## The analysis has produced several notable findings:

* Overall Decrease: There was an impressive 45.10% decrease in CO2 intensity across European countries from 1990 to 2017, indicating significant progress in reducing carbon emissions.

* Largest Decrease Period: The most substantial reduction occurred from 1995 to 2002, with a remarkable 15.32% decrease in CO2 intensity. This period represents a pivotal moment in environmental improvement.

* Estonia's Challenge: Estonia stood out as the country with the highest average CO2 intensity during this time frame, raising concerns about its environmental performance.

* Lowest Decrease in Estonia: Interestingly, Estonia also demonstrated the lowest decrease in CO2 intensity, with a reduction of less than 1%. This calls for further investigation into the effectiveness of Estonia's environmental policies.

* Environmental Leaders: On a positive note, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden ranked as the countries with the lowest average CO2 intensity, illustrating their exemplary environmental efforts.

* Regional Differences: The map plot in the notebook visually highlighted that Eastern European countries, Balkan countries, and Estonia had higher CO2 intensity in 2017 compared to the rest of Europe. This emphasizes the need for region-specific environmental measures.
